#System of Linear Eqations

A system of linear equations can be written as a matrix equation in the form Ax=b. Where A is the coefficient matrix, x are the variables and b is an offset vector.

To solve a system of linear equations write a matrix in the from (A|b).

For example to solve the following problem:

2x  -   y +  4z = 5

5x  +  2y - 10z = 7

12x -  9y -  8z = 11

enter the matrix as (A|b):

and analyse this matrix to:

where x is the solution of the problem.
