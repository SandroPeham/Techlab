#Matrix

When you analyse a square matrix, you get the following results: 

- Inverse
- Determinant

For example:

<img style='margin: 0 auto' src="https://github.com/SandroPeham/Techlab/blob/master/Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%2019%20Jan%202017%2C%2019.49.10.png" width=608 height=512>

leads to:

<img style='margin: 0 auto' src="https://github.com/SandroPeham/Techlab/blob/master/Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%2019%20Jan%202017%2C%2019.48.07.png" width=808 height=512>

For other results make a new Issue here on github.
